# Test Suite Component Usage

## Holmes CSS Debugger

See the original project on [GitHub](https://github.com/redroot/holmes) for more.

Holmes.css is an HTML5 and CSS debugging file. It will outline any errors in either red (urgent) or yellow (warning). You can use it in 2 simple steps:

1. Add a class of `holmes-debug` to your `<html>` or `<body>` tag.

2. Reference the `holmes.min.css` file either in your HTML or as a stylesheet import then view your page!

# WARNING

	The test suite is a work in progress and very incomplete. I will do my best to add better documentation and relevant tests as soon as possible.
